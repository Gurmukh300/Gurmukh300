### Hi there, I'm Gurmukh Singh ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a junior developer focused on web development. I am working with HTML, CSS, React, and JavaScript for front-end development, and Ruby, Python for back-end development, and Ruby on Rails framework.
In the past, I had been working as a machinist, leading a team and taking care of task deliverables. My passion and curiosity for software development brought me to Le Wagon coding Bootcamp where I learned about front-end, and back-end development.
In my free time, I like to play video games and do some DIY projects.
