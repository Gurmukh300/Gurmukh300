### Hi there, I'm Gurmukh Singh ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a full-stack developer, working with HTML, CSS, React, Nextjs, and JavaScript for front-end development, and Ruby, Python for back-end development, and Ruby on Rails framework.
In the past, I had been working as a machinist, leading a team and taking care of task deliverables. My passion and curiosity for software development brought me to Le Wagon coding Bootcamp where I learned about full-stack development.
I am always keen to learn more about technologies.
In my free time, I like to do gardening and some DIY projects.
